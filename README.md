Mentoring Cockpit Service
===========================================
This repository is part of the bachelor thesis 'A Multimodal Mentoring Cockpit for Tutor Support'.
The Mentoring Cockpit Service is a las2peer service, which enables the connection between Learning Locker and Mentoring Cockpit.
The service manages tutors' access rights and provides aggregated data for permitted Learning Management System (LMS) courses.

Database
---------
Access rights are stored in a MySQL database. You can find an sql file for setting up the database in the [etc](etc) folder. You'll have to fill and mange the database yourself. For example:

| SUB  | COURSELINK | COURSENAME |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| tutor1-sub  | http://example-lms/example-course1 | Course1 |
| tutor1-sub  | http://example-lms/example-course2  | Course2 |
| tutor2-sub  | http://example-lms/example-course2  | Course2 |
|  ... | ...  | ... |


Learning Locker Aggregation HTTP interface
-------------------------------------
Statements in Learning Record Stores (LRS) are very rich and half of the information you don't need when displaying the data. Therefore, the [Learning Locker Aggregation HTTP interface](http://docs.learninglocker.net/http-aggregation) allows you to access MongoDBâ€™s powerful Aggregation API for more custom filtration of statements.


Service setup
-------------
To set up the service configure the [property file](etc/i5.las2peer.services.mentoringCockpitService.MentoringCockService.properties) file with your database credentials and Learning Locker authentication.
```INI
lrsDomain = http://exampleDomain/api/statements/aggregate?
lrsAuth = Basic exampleauth
mysqlUser = exampleuser
mysqlPassword = examplepass
mysqlHost = localhost
mysqlPort = 3306
mysqlDatabase = exampledb
```

Build
--------
Execute the following command on your shell:

```shell
ant jar 
```

Start
--------

To start the moodle-data-proxy service, follow the [Starting-A-las2peer-Network tutorial](https://github.com/rwth-acis/las2peer-Template-Project/wiki/Starting-A-las2peer-Network).


Getting the data in the Front-end application
-----------------------

To get the student data to the Front-end, a RESTful GET requests are offered by the service. 

To get a JSON list of courses where a tutor has access rights:
```
GET <service-address>/mentoring/<tutor-sub>/courseList.
```

To get a JSON list of students enrolled in a course:
```
GET <service-address>/mentoring/<tutor-sub>/<encoded-courselink>/students.
```
 
To get a JSON list of students' results in a course:
```
GET <service-address>/mentoring/<tutor-sub>/<encoded-courselink>/results.
```

Therefore, replace *service-address* with your service address and *turor-sub* with the tutor sub specified in the MySQL database.



How to run using Docker
-------------------

First build the image:
```bash
docker build . -t mentoring-cockpit-service
```

Then you can run the image like this:

```bash
docker run -e LRS_DOMAIN=lrsDomain -e LRS_AUTH=lrsAuth -e MYSQL_USER=mysqlUser -e MYSQL_PASSWORD=mysqlPassword -e MYSQL_HOST=mysqlHost -e MYSQL_PORT=mysqlPort -e MYSQL_DATABASE=mysqlDatabase -p 9011:9011 mentoring-cockpit-service
```

Replace *lrsDomain* with your Learning Locker domain, *lrsAuth* with the corresponding authentication, *mysqlUser* with the MySQL user name, *mysqlPassword* with the MySQL password, *mysqlHost* with the MySQL host, *mysqlPort* with the MySQL port, and *mysqlDatabase* with the MySQL database name. 

*Do not forget to persist you database data*
